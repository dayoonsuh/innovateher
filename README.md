## Inspiration
Over winter break, some of our teammates set out on vacations, while others stayed home, overwhelmed by the challenge of planning. One teammate shared how planning a trip to Hawaii took her six whole months, navigating countless websites and meticulously figuring out the best order to do everything. Others dreamed of traveling but felt stuck—not knowing where to go or how to begin planning. One teammate, inspired by the idea of solo travel for women, hesitated due to safety concerns and the lack of clear guidance.

This sparked an idea: what if we could create a trip-planning platform designed to empower women to explore the world confidently and effortlessly? With HerAdventure, we aim to simplify vacation planning, helping women embrace new adventures, discover the beauty of the world, and make memories without the stress.

## What it does
Simply start by entering your destination, travel dates, current location, purpose of travel, and who you're traveling with. The website generates personalized itineraries and provides all the necessary links for your convenience, such as booking hotels and flights (if needed), YouTube videos showcasing your destination, and links to recommended restaurants, cafes, and attractions. No more tedious searching—this website consolidates everything you need in one place. What makes our website stand out from simply using ChatGPT is that it combines real-time APIs, curated travel data, and direct real-time booking links into a seamless, user-friendly experience tailored specifically for travelers.

## How we built it
We built HerAdventure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website’s functionality and user interface. We integrated the OpenAI API to generate personalized vacation plans, the YouTube API to find relevant videos showcasing destinations, and Google Maps to locate and link recommended restaurants, cafes, and attractions. For collaboration, we used Git throughout the development process. Additionally, we employed web scraping techniques to gather data from flight and hotel websites, providing users with booking options directly on our platform.

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered several challenges during the development process. One major hurdle was merging the frontend and backend, particularly connecting Python with JavaScript, as we struggled to get Flask to function correctly. Initially, we planned to use TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit APIs to gather viral travel recommendations, but we realized that implementing effective data mining was beyond our current expertise. Additionally, limited time for debugging made it difficult to resolve all issues, which added to the complexity of the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully integrating OpenAI, Google Maps, and YouTube APIs into our website. Learning new technologies such as API implementation and web scraping was a significant achievement, as was mastering how to use these tools effectively within a short timeframe. We take pride in our teamwork, supporting each other throughout the hackathon, and overcoming challenges together. The mistakes we made along the way became valuable lessons, helping us improve and grow for future projects. Lastly, we are proud of the vision behind our project and the progress we made in turning it into reality.

## What we learned
We learned how to connect the frontend and backend effectively, explored how APIs function, and gained hands-on experience with web scraping. Additionally, we learned to never underestimate the time required to build a project, as unexpected issues can arise. We also deepened our understanding of teamwork, problem-solving, and adapting to technical roadblocks. Finally, we learned the importance of user-centric design and how to integrate multiple technologies into one cohesive platform.

## What's next for HerAdventure
Next, we plan to integrate TikTok, Instagram, and Reddit APIs to curate viral and trending travel recommendations. We also aim to enhance the visual appeal of our website with a more polished and intuitive design. Additionally, we want to implement features like budget tracking, personalized packing lists, and AI-driven safety recommendations for solo female travelers. These updates will make HerAdventure a more comprehensive and empowering tool for travelers worldwide.
